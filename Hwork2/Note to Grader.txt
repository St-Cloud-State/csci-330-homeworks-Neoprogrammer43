Not to grader: All the functions executed the ones as intended, even those that were supposed to give errors like
in 3.21. The exception to this is (mystery â€™(zowie)). The first time I did this function I put the apostrophe in the 
wrong place. However, I fixed this error by the second time I typed it in and it executed sucesfully.
